\section{User Stories}\label{sec:user-stories}
There were two viable user stories for this project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a \emph{researcher/student/educator/engineer}, I want to draw circuits for \LaTeX documents using a GUI so that I can draw the circuits more quickly than I can code them.
    \item As a \emph{researcher/student/educator/engineer}, I want to draw circuits for \LaTeX documents using a GUI so that I do not need to be a \LaTeX \emph{expert} to draw circuits.
\end{enumerate}

Since any person who is writing a \LaTeX document must have some level of coding knowledge, expecting users to slightly modify circuit code is a reasonable expectation.
Therefore, the following user story was considered, but ultimately not included in the planning process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\color{red}As a researcher/student/educator/engineer, I want to draw circuits for \LaTeX documents using a GUI so that I do not require any \LaTeX knowledge.}
\end{itemize}
