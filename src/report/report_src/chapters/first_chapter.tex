\section{Phases}\label{sec:phases}
This project execution was divided into three distinct phases:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item {\textbf Phase 1}: Team of four.
 \item {\textbf Phase 2}: Agile (Scrum) with three-member team.
 \item {\textbf Phase 3}: Replace Agile with Project Management Lite~\cite{pmlite}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 1}\label{subsec:phase-1}
This project began around October 2021 with a team of four students.
After beginning the project, Frances Joy Poblete disenrolled from HAW.
Her disenrollment caused the team to reevaluate the scope of the project.

\subsection{Phase 2}\label{subsec:phase-2}
Follow Ms. Poblete's disenrollment, the remaining team members decided to adopt an Agile (Scrum) approach to project management.

\subsection{Phase 3}\label{subsec:phase-3}
