Notes on XML
Ignore mxCell with id="0" and id="1", required in XML for draw.io, but seems unnecessary for Circuitikz
Regarding lines
   With a line connecting two components, ignore mxPoints under mxGeometry,
     instead Array with mxPoints designate the corners of the line,
     in order of top to bottom the corners when drawing a line from the source to the target
   With a line with only one end connected to a component, mxPoint under mxGeometry indicates location of loose end
     If mxCell style attribute only has source attribute, mxPoint labelled targetPoint indicates loose end
     If mxCell style attribute only has target attribute, mxPoint labelled sourcePoint indicates loose end
'style' attribute of lines
   exitX=0 for source's connection point on left side at rotation=0, if =1 point on right side
   exitY=0 for source's connection point on top side at rotation=0, if =1 point on bottom side
   exitDx=10 shifts the source's connection point from left side in rightwards direction by one notch of grid
   exitDy=10 shifts the source's connection point from top side in downward direction by one notch of grid
   entryX / entryY / entryDx / entryDy are the same, but for the target component at rotation=0
'x' and 'y' in mxGeometry under mxCell indicates the upperleft corner of the component at rotation=0
   x=10 moves rightwards by one notch of grid, x=40 for moving by one bold line; same for y=10 in downwards direction
